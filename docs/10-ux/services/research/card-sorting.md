# Card Sorting

## What it is:
A simple yet powerful technique for learning about how people think about and describe categories and concepts, and what information belongs in which category. Very useful for planning website structure, navigation, and taxonomy that reflects how users view content. A user research method for information architects.

## Why to do it:
* Helps the team understand the people we are designing for
* Uncovers users' mental model for a particular information space
* Provides an external (user) perspective to help the team and stakeholders come to a consensus about what organizational scheme to use
* Gathers lists of words people use to describe groups of information

## How to do it:
1. Decide what you want to learn.
    * Do you need to learn broad ideas about the information space? Validate a draft structure? Explore a structural idea in detail? Compare different audience groups? Justify a recommendation?
    * Common goals:
      * Learn how users think about the content and main groups to create top-level categories and sub-categories
      * Discover high level concepts in content to better understand content relationships
      * Explore classification schemes for content to guide whether to offer information to users in one or many ways
      * Find out why a small section of a site is not working well
      * Collect names to use for labels or taxonomies
    * Before running a card sort, you need to understand the content you'll be working with so that you can choose appropriate content for the sort and ask the right questions

2. Select the appropriate method (open, closed or hybrid; team or individual):
    * Open card sort: a generative exercise; give participants a set of "cards" (paper index cards or a digital equivalent) and ask them to sort the cards into groups according to what's similar, and to name and/or describe the groups in whatever way makes sense to them; you can learn the most from this method if you use it when you're at the beginning of a design or redesign project
    * Closed card sort: give people a set of cards and a predefined set of categories and ask them to sort the cards into the categories; use this type if you have a set of categories that can't be changed but you want to learn which content should go where, or you are adding a small amount of content to an existing structure
    * Hybrid is a kind of combination of closed and open. See Optimal Workshop's tips for [choosing the right card sorting technique based on your goals](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/101/card-sorting#sectionObjectives)
    * Team
    * Individual

3. Choose the content.

4. Recruit and invite participants.

5. Run the sort, record the data, analyze the outcomes.

NOTE: Use card sorting in combination with complimentary user research techniques to understand what people need and how they approach tasks; for example: [interviews](stakeholder-interviews-guide.md), surveys, and existing analytics review.
